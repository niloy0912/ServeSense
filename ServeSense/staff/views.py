Staff App - Views Documentation
-----------------------------

staff_list(request):
This function is responsible for the main staff overview page. 
Its primary job is to fetch every user object from the database using User.objects.all(). 
It then packages this list of staff members into a context dictionary and passes it 
to the 'staff_list.html' template, which handles the actual display.

edit_staff(request, staff_id):
This view manages the process of updating a staff member's profile.
It takes a 'staff_id' from the URL to identify which user to edit, using 
get_object_or_404 to safely retrieve them. If the request is a POST, it means 
a form was submitted, so it validates the data using the EditStaffForm and saves 
the changes. If it's a GET request, it simply displays the same form, but 
pre-filled with the staff member's current information.

add_staff(request):
This view handles the creation of a new staff member account. It uses the 
custom AddStaffForm, which is based on Django's UserCreationForm to ensure 
passwords are handled securely. On a GET request, it shows a blank form. 
On a POST request, it validates the submitted data and, if valid, saves the new 
user to the database before redirecting the manager back to the main staff list.

clock_in(request, staff_id):
This is a simple action-oriented view that handles when a staff member starts their shift.
It finds the specific user by their ID, sets their 'is_on_duty' status to True,
and saves the change. Critically, it also creates a new record in the Attendance table,
linking it to the staff member and automatically timestamping the clock-in time.
It does not render a template; it simply redirects back to the staff list.

clock_out(request, staff_id):
This view handles the end of a staff member's shift. It finds the user and sets
their 'is_on_duty' status to False. It then attempts to find the most recent
'Attendance' record for that user that does not yet have a clock-out time. 
If it finds one, it updates the 'clock_out_time' to the current time, effectively
ending the shift log. The 'try...except' block safely handles cases where an open
shift might not be found, preventing the application from crashing.

attendance_log(request):
This function is built to display the complete history of all staff shifts.
It queries the Attendance model to get every single record. It orders the results
by 'clock_in_time' in descending order ('-clock_in_time') so that the most recent
shifts appear at the top of the list. It then passes this list of logs to the 
'attendance_log.html' template for display.
